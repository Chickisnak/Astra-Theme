      <p>
        Your customers just learned what services you offer. Tell them why they <br>should work with you or your team,
        for example you could highlight your<br> experience and positive client reviews.<br><br>
        The badges illustrate this. We also focus on key benefits they will get while <br> using our services, namely
        quick turnaround times and dedicated support.<br> You could also use them to show awards you won for your best
        work.
